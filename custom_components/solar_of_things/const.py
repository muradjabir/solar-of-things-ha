]

# ─── Energy-flow fallback mapping ──────────────────────────────────────────────
# Several inverter / WiFi-dongle firmware families never populate the historical
# time-series endpoint (API_TIME_SERIES) that this integration reads by default,
# so every realtime sensor stays "unknown" while the portal shows live data.
# Reported for UWB1, RWB1-0x, JC-62xx, DatouBoss DT-series and EASUN units in
# https://github.com/Conexo-Casa/solar-of-things-ha/issues/7 (and #3, #8, #11,
# #14, #15).  Those devices serve live values from API_ENERGY_FLOW instead,
# under a different set of field names.
#
# Each canonical sensor key maps to an ordered list of rules.  The first rule
# that produces a usable number wins.  A rule is (mode, source_fields, scale):
#   "first" – use the first source field that is present
#   "sum"   – add every source field that is present (multi-string PV inputs)
# `scale` converts the source value into the unit declared in
# SENSOR_DEFINITIONS.
#
# ONLY mappings whose unit AND (where relevant) sign are confirmed by an
# observed value are enabled here — no rule in this table can be 1000x wrong
# or have charge/discharge backwards. Two capture rounds confirmed the table
# below:
#   Night (0 W, settles nothing but the always-zero fields):
#     bmsBatteryVoltage / positiveTerminalBatteryVoltage   26.6 V
#     batteryPercentage / bmsSOC                           100 %
#     batteryPower                                         9 W
#     pv1Power / pv2Power                                  W (labelled; 0 at night)
#   Daylight, four states — AC/no-AC x charging/discharging (issue #7,
#   2026-09-15, hidemichixt-creator's four-file capture set) — settled the
#   rest via the API's own per-field "unit" tag plus arithmetic cross-checks:
#     load_power              "unit": "kW" in the payload itself (not guessed).
#                              AC Output Power / Load Power.
#     aPhaseMainsPower/b/c     "unit": "W" in the payload itself. Sign confirmed
#                              by conservation of power: load_power + charging
#                              batteryPower − pv1Power reproduces
#                              |aPhaseMainsPower| to within rounding in both
#                              AC-connected samples (e.g. 614+720−234=1100 W).
#                              Negative = importing from mains, positive =
#                              feeding in — confirmed directly (not just by
#                              symmetry) by a follow-up capture with the
#                              battery full and PV surplus flowing out
#                              (897 W PV, 0 W battery, 351 W load ->
#                              +495 W on aPhaseMainsPower, the ~50 W gap
#                              being ordinary inverter conversion loss).
#     positiveTerminalBatteryCurrent   Sign flips consistently across all four
#                              states: negative while charging (-17.6, -27 A),
#                              positive while discharging (+25.5, +17.6 A).
#                              negativeTerminalBatteryCurrent stayed 0 in every
#                              sample on this device/firmware and is still
#                              unused — see ENERGY_FLOW_UNVERIFIED.
# Rule modes: "first" (first present source wins), "sum" (add every present
# source), "clamp_pos" (sum, then max(0, total) — the positive/export half of
# a signed field), "clamp_neg" (sum, then max(0, -total) — the negative/import
# half). `scale` converts the source value into the unit declared in
# SENSOR_DEFINITIONS.

# the same class of bug #13 already fixed for sensor *reads*, but here for
# control *writes* (and their matching read-back for current state). Confirmed
# by lukaszkwapien's full writable-config dump for a FCHAO inverter (#18):
#   Output Source Priority: the documented `outputSourcePrioritySetting` fails
#   with `code=70134 "Config attribute not exists"` on this firmware, which
#   exposes the same control as `setOutputSourcePriority` instead.
# Every other control below has no confirmed alternate name yet — its tuple is
# just itself. The same dump also confirmed FCHAO does not expose
# batteryChargeLimit / batteryDischargeLimit / gridChargeLimit under ANY name;
# for those, resolve_setting_key() in api.py returning None is used to mark
# the entity unavailable rather than let the user trigger a write that is
# guaranteed to fail with the same portal error.
